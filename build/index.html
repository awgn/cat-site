<h3>Welcome to Cat!</h3>

<img src="/images/haskell-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

<p>Cat is a C++14 functional library inspired by category theory 
and the Haskell language.</p>
<p>The purpose of cat is to provide utility functions and type classes not included
into the standard library and enable the functional programming paradigm in C++.</p>

<p>More information on type classes can be found at the following address:
