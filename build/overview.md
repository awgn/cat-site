### Rationale 


The purpose of the Cat library is twofold: 

* on the one hand it provides utilities and functions not available in the standard 
C++ library with respect to functional programming. 
* on the other hand it implements an extensible framework of type classes to attain 
a better reusability of code through the principles of category theory.


### Features

The Cat library:

* is lightweight. Each function and object shipped with the library
takes advantage of modern C++ features, such as `constexpr` constructs, movability, 
perfect forwarding, etc.
* is written in portable C++14, without using macro black-magic and with a pinch 
of template meta-programming, limited only in the implementation of type traits.
* extends the standard type traits with a set specifically tailored to generic and 
functional programming (e.g. `is_container`, `is_associative_container`, `function_type`, 
`function_arity`, `return_type`, `is_callable` to mention a few).
* provides utilities, like callable wrappers, enabling functional composition and 
currying on-top-of any kind of callable types (including `std::bind` expressions 
and generic lambdas).
* provides functions that operate on `std::tuple` and generic containers. 
* provides utilities that allow for perfect forwarding from containers in for-loop 
statements with `forward_as` or via the iterator adaptor `forward_iterator`.  
* includes an extensible framework for building type classes and provides the
implementation of the following ones:
    * Functor
    * Bifunctor
    * Applicative
    * Alternative 
    * Monoid 
    * Monad
    * MonadPlus
    * Foldable
    * Show
    * Read
    * ...

* provides instances of standard C++ types for the above-mentioned type classes.

### Notes

At the present moment the Cat library is tested under Linux with both glibcxx and libc++
library and with the following compilers:
    
* gcc-4.9
* gcc-5 
* clang-3.5 
* clang 3.6
